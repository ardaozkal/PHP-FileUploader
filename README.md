# PHP-FileUploader

Simple file uploader script in PHP, with SHA512 password system.

## Notice: Archived

This project was followed by a closed source php script code named "ImgUp", which was then followed by elixire, which is open source. 

This project is not indicative of my programming abilities, as it was hacked together quickly to just *work*.

This is not a very secure script, it's not maintained, and you're recommended to use elixire instead.
